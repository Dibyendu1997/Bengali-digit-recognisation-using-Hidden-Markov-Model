# Bengali-digit-recognition-using-Hidden-Markov-Model
## INTRODUCTION
The aim of this project is to implement automatic speech recognition algorithms using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for Bengali languages. We have self-recorded Bengali digits From all over the State.
## LITERATURE REVIEW
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a well researched field. The utilization of HMMs for ASR is studied well in [The Application of Hidden Markov Models in Speech Recognition](https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/Faculty/Rabiner/ece259/Reprints/tutorial%20on%20hmm%20and%20applications.pdf). The paper presents the core architecture of a HMM-based Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) system and then describes ways to achieve state-of-the-art performance.

In the past few years, there has been significant work on developing speech recognition systems using HMMs for regional Indian languages. [Syllable Based Continuous Speech Recognition for Tamil Language](/References/Syllable_Based_Recognition_for_Tamil.pdf) uses MFCC feature vectors and an acoustic HMM model to develop a recognition system for Bengali
