# Bengali-digit-recognition-using-Hidden-Markov-Model
## INTRODUCTION
The aim of this project is to implement automatic speech recognition algorithms using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for Bengali languages. We have self-recorded Bengali digits From all over the State.
## LITERATURE REVIEW
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a well researched field. The utilization of HMMs for ASR is studied well in [The Application of Hidden Markov Models in Speech Recognition](https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/Faculty/Rabiner/ece259/Reprints/tutorial%20on%20hmm%20and%20applications.pdf). The paper presents the core architecture of a HMM-based Large Vocabulary Continuous Speech Recognition (LVCSR) system and then describes ways to achieve state-of-the-art performance.
